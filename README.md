# iBook - Facebook Crawler

A simple web app for programmatically creating facebook applications using PhantomJS to crawl.

### The Need

Facebook allows developers to query their API with highly restricted access rates. While this works for small apps, it fails when the application scales. To subvert this rule, we must programatically create a facebook app for each user and funnel data through it.

## How to use this Project
